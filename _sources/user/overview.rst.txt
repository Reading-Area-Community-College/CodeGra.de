Overview of CodeGrade
======================

CodeGrade can be used both as a stand-alone web application and as a module in
your LMS. The following chapters apply to both situations. Please consult the
:ref:`LMS Integration <lms-chapter>` chapter for detailed information of
integrating CodeGrade into your Learning Management System.

This chapter provides a brief overview of the components and navigation in
CodeGrade.

.. note::

    CodeGrade uses an extensive :ref:`permissions <permissions-chapter>` system
    that may allow certain features to be disabled on your CodeGrade account.

General Site
-------------

CodeGrade allows for the :ref:`creation of courses and assignments
<management-chapter>`.

.. note:: CodeGrade assignments can also be created in co-operative Learning Management Systems.

Each assignment is part of a course and each course can have multiple
assignments linked to it. All courses and assignments have individual settings
pages. With the right :ref:`permissions <permissions-chapter>` these pages allow
for adding users to the course, changing the details of an assignment, dividing
submissions over teachers, running linters over assignments, adding a CGIgnore
file, sending notifications to students and teachers and adding or customizing
rubrics.

Assignments handed in via CodeGrade can be viewed using the :ref:`Codeviewer
<codeviewer-chapter>`. The Codeviewer allows for a convenient way to review and
grade submissions online. The features include line for line feedback and a file
browser.

New courses can be created by the site administrators. They can also add
students, teachers and teaching assistants to these courses. New roles can be
created and :ref:`permissions <permissions-chapter>` of existing roles can be
altered by site administrators too. All users on CodeGrade can set
:ref:`personal site preferences and edit account information
<preferences-chapter>`.

Filesystem
-----------

The `CodeGrade Filesystem <https://fs-docs.codegra.de>`__ (or CodeGra.fs) can be
used in combination with the web application.  It can mount a local CodeGrade
instance on your computer to browse the assignments and files on the server. The
filesystem can be used for students to locally work on the CodeGrade mount and
thus automatically hand in the assignment with each save.  For teachers the
filesystem can be used to locally grade work without any overhead using a
preferred editor.

All features of the online :ref:`Codeviewer <codeviewer-chapter>` (e.g. line for
line feedback, filling in rubrics and adding general grades and feedback) can
also be done locally using the filesystem. Editor plugins can be installed and
used for most popular editors to enable this.
